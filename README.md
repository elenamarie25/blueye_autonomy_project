# Modular Sensor Mounting System for Blueye ROV

This open-source library contains 3D-printable mounting solutions for attaching various sensors to the Blueye ROV.

The mounts are designed to fit specific sensors such as:
- USBL modem
- DVL (Doppler Velocity Log)
- Compute Bottle
- Forward-looking sonar
- Inductive charging coil

## 🔧 Customization
The files are provided in .STL (ready to print) and .STEP (editable) formats as well as CAD links so that users can adapt the mounts for their own sensor configurations or ROV modifications.

## 📦 What's included
- Mounting base designs
- Modular connector elements
- Sensor-specific brackets
- Assembly documentation and How-to's
