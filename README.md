# Modular Sensor Mount for Blueye ROV

This open-source library contains 3D-printable mounting solutions for attaching various sensors to the Blueye ROV as part of its conversion into an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV).

The mounts are designed to fit specific sensors such as:
- USBL modem
- DVL (Doppler Velocity Log)
- GPS module
- Forward-looking sonar
- Inductive charging coil
- Downward camera and lights

## 🔧 Customization
The files are provided in .STL (ready to print) and .STEP (editable) formats so that users can adapt the mounts for their own sensor configurations or ROV modifications.

## 📦 What's included
- Mounting base designs
- Modular connector elements
- Sensor-specific brackets
- Assembly documentation (if available)
